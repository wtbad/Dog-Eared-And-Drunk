    <h3>Call It What You Want: A Reflection on Love, Loss, and Self-Worth</h3>
    <p>A 
As any sane individual would, I bought that pink-covered book I spotted at the high-end bookstore at Cape Town Airport. Should I have bought some unnecessary, high-priced souvenirs too? Certainly not. But then there I was, holding Call It What You Want by Alissa DeRogatis and eager to read it.Of course, the three glasses of airport wine had other ideas , and by the time I returned home on a flight, I never got to open the book. A month later, though, I finally did—and it resonated to my experience.

This book is a candid reflection of feelings I am all too familiar with, especially for those who have been stuck in a toxic relationship like myself. My five-year relationship made me feel broken, questioning my self-worth, and if I would ever get to the point of loving myself whole again. The book hit me on all levels, and the lines that Carrie and Sloane, the heroines, spoke were real to me for the pain and the confusion that I had felt for so long.

One of my favorite quotes that deeply resonated with me was:

"Stop losing your mind over someone who doesn't mind losing you."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

I dedicated years of my life giving it my all to someone who never truly cared for me in the same manner. It was like I was perpetually losing myself, trying to hold on to someone who could barely be bothered to remain. My self-esteem was shattered in those moments, as I tried talking myself into believing that my love somehow would correct the situation. I knew deep within my heart, I deserved better than that.

"You are worthy of someone who goes out of their way to make it clear that they need you in their life."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

That's something that I did not know for way too long. I stayed for so long embracing crumbs of love, thinking it was enough. But it never was. I let myself settle for what I could be, thinking it was better than nothing. But in my heart, I knew that I deserved better than that; I deserved someone who would choose me every day. And when I knew it finally, it was a breaking point:

"I didn't care that I was accepting half of a relationship with him when I knew I deserved so much better."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

That awareness didn't come quickly, and even when I released it, the emotional wounds remained. It took me many years to realize that life was made up of moments, and those painful ones would be over, but they'd also form who I was becoming. The more I looked back, the more I realized that:

"It took me years to figure out that life is just a string of these so-called passing moments. If it's a lousy moment, it will pass. If it's a fantastic moment, it will pass."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

We sometimes end up stuck in toxic loops, replaying the good times over and over, and ignoring the pain that went with them. I couldn't even try to estimate how many times I ended up romanticizing the good times, and ignoring the nights of quiet, the screaming, and the tears. It's so easy to look back and see only what we want:

"It's so easy to look back and romanticize the good. The laughs, the kisses, the dates, the road trips. But what about the fights? The screaming, the crying, the nights you slept on the couch. Never recorded, hardly mentioned. It's like they never occurred."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

The connection I held on to for so long wasn't perfect, but my mind had me thinking it was something that it never was. The longer I dwelled upon it, the more I realized the damage that it had done—not only to my well-being, but to my sense of self-value. And still, in the midst of it all, there was a place inside of me that thought:

"Why did I fall for someone who wasn't capable of loving me back? Initially, I believed he was my 'right person, wrong time.' Now I'm starting to think that's what you say when you love someone this hard and you know this person can't, and never will, love you back the same."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

It took me years to understand that the idea of "right person, wrong time" was just an excuse for a love that never had any return. I wasn't wrong to love, I was wrong to think that someone who didn't value me would ever really love me back.

The hardest of all was finding out that
"You can't beg someone to love you, as much as I wish you can, you can't. You shouldn't have to convince someone that you're good enough or you're worth it."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want

And yet, for all those years, I did exactly that. I pleaded for validation. I convinced myself that if I gave enough of myself, I would be given the love I craved in return. But really, it was never about what I had to offer—it was about what he would offer, and it was never, ever enough.

Reading Call It What You Want made me aware of the emotional bruises I'd been carrying from the relationship. But it also made me feel like I don't need to keep reliving the past to figure out my future. There is life after a toxic relationship, and even when it doesn't feel that way in the beginning, you can find your way back to yourself. The best thing is to shatter the habit of accepting, of feeling you're not good enough, and start perceiving that you are better than that.

Love is not, in the end, about making someone see your value; it's seeing your value yourself, even if no one else sees it.

"Life got so much better when I stopped looking for love in every guy I met."
― Alissa DeRogatis, Call It What You Want.</p>
